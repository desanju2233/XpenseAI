# XpenseAI

The goal of this project is an intelligent finance companion that not only simplifies expense tracking but also provides actionable insights.

This is a Streamlit-based web application designed for personal finance management. It allows users to track expenses, record payments, set savings goals, and predict potential savings across various expense categories using a machine learning model. The app integrates a SQLite database for user authentication and data storage, and it features a simple neural network for savings prediction.

# Model Details
The savings prediction model is a multi-output neural network designed to predict potential savings in 8 variable expense categories based on user financial data.

## Input Features
Total Features: 18
Numerical Features (14):
Income: Monthly income (float)
Age: User age (integer)
Dependents: Number of dependents (integer)
Disposable_Income: Income after fixed expenses (float)
Desired_Savings: Target savings amount (float)
Groceries, Transport, Eating_Out, Entertainment, Utilities, Healthcare, Education, Miscellaneous: Monthly spending in each category (float)
Preprocessing: Normalized using StandardScaler to zero mean and unit variance.
Categorical Features (2, expanded to 4 after encoding):
Occupation: User’s job type (e.g., Professional, Student, Other)
City_Tier: City cost-of-living tier (e.g., Tier_1, Tier_2, Tier_3)
Preprocessing: One-hot encoded with OneHotEncoder(drop='first'), producing 2 features each (e.g., Occupation_Student, Occupation_Other, City_Tier_Tier_2, City_Tier_Tier_3).

## Output
Targets: 8 continuous values representing potential savings:
Potential_Savings_Groceries, Potential_Savings_Transport, Potential_Savings_Eating_Out, Potential_Savings_Entertainment, Potential_Savings_Utilities, Potential_Savings_Healthcare, Potential_Savings_Education, Potential_Savings_Miscellaneous
Interpretation: Predicted amounts that could be saved in each category based on input spending patterns.

### Architecture
Input Layer: Shape (18,) for 18 features.
Hidden Layers:
Dense (128 units, ReLU): Fully connected layer to extract features.
BatchNormalization: Normalizes layer outputs for training stability.
Dropout (0.3): Prevents overfitting by randomly dropping 30% of units.
Dense (64 units, ReLU): Further feature refinement.
BatchNormalization: Stabilizes training.
Dropout (0.3): Reduces overfitting.
Dense (32 units, ReLU): Compresses features for output prediction.
Output Layer: Dense layer with 8 units (linear activation) for the 8 savings predictions.
Total Parameters: Approximately 20,000 (exact count depends on model.summary() output)

### Training Process
Loss Function: MeanSquaredError (MSE) to minimize the difference between predicted and actual savings.
Optimizer: Adam with default learning rate (adaptive for faster convergence).
Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE) per category for evaluation.
Callbacks:
EarlyStopping: Stops training if val_loss doesn’t improve for 5 epochs, restoring best weights.
ReduceLROnPlateau: Reduces learning rate by 0.5 if val_loss stalls for 3 epochs (minimum 1e-6).
Hyperparameters:
Epochs: Up to 100
Batch Size: 64
Validation Split: 20% of training data
Data Split: 80% train, 20% test (random state 42).
Preprocessing
Numerical: Scaled with StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally.
Categorical: Encoded with OneHotEncoder to convert categories into binary vectors, dropping the first category to avoid multicollinearity.
### Dataset

Monthly Expenses:
Categories like Rent, Loan_Repayment, Insurance, Groceries, Transport, Eating_Out, Entertainment, Utilities, Healthcare, Education, and Miscellaneous record various monthly expenses.
Financial Goals & Savings:
Desired_Savings_Percentage and Desired_Savings: Targets for monthly savings.
Disposable_Income: Income remaining after all expenses are accounted for.
Potential Savings:
Includes estimates of potential savings across different spending areas such as Groceries, Transport, Eating_Out, Entertainment, Utilities, Healthcare, Education, and Miscellaneous.

### Why This is "Perfect"
1. **Accuracy**: Corrected feature count to 18, aligned dataset with model inputs, and fixed project name consistency.
2. **Completeness**: Added all sections (setup, deployment, usage, model details, etc.).
3. **Clarity**: Improved formatting with proper headings and code blocks.
4. **Dataset**: Specified the Kaggle dataset and clarified its use, noting unused columns.
5. **Model Depth**: Detailed every layer, preprocessing step, and training parameter.
6. **Actionable**: Provides clear instructions for setup, training, and deployment.

### Drawbacks
**`Limited Model Complexity`** : The simple feedforward neural network may not capture complex spending patterns or non-linear relationships as effectively as more advanced models (e.g., LSTMs or transformers).
**`Static Predictions`**: Predictions are based on a snapshot of data and don’t account for real-time changes or seasonal trends unless the model is retrained frequently.
**`Dataset Dependency`**: Relies heavily on the quality and relevance of the training dataset. The Kaggle dataset may not generalize well to non-Indian demographics or atypical financial situations.
**`Security Risks`**: Plaintext password storage in xpenseai.db poses a significant security risk if the app is deployed publicly without hashing.
**`Incomplete Database Integration`**: Savings predictions use xpenseai.db only on the 1st of the month, limiting continuous tracking unless manually updated.
** `Assumed Features`**: Functionality like OCR and dashboard visualizations is assumed but not fully detailed, potentially leading to incomplete user experience if not implemented.
